Analysis: Narrowing down the top 20 cities within the U.S. that have the highest  								
median salaries was the ultimate goal for this project. I tried to pick at least two 								
cities per state as well as the government/capital city of each state. Cities in this								
study were picked based on capitals and larger populations. I gathered and cleaned								
data for 10th,25th,50th,75th, and 90th percentiles. In the end I sorted my state list based on 								
highest-median salaries for entry level data analysts. The majorty of the top 10 states are								
the same for all percentiles. The top 20 states are as listed below in order from highest-								
median salaries to lowest:
